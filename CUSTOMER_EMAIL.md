## Initial introduction (after discovery call)

**Subject:** CloudLens AutoPilot for AWS — next steps for your visibility deployment

> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> Following our conversation, here's the next-step package for deploying Keysight CloudLens visibility on your AWS account using our AutoPilot platform.
>
> **What AutoPilot delivers:**
>
> - Full CloudLens stack (KVO + CLMS + vPB + collector SVMs) deployed via CloudFormation or Terraform — your choice
> - AWS-native sensor rollout to every tagged EC2 instance via SSM Run Command (no SSH or WinRM access required)
> - VPC Traffic Mirroring auto-managed by KVO, with sub-second new-instance detection via our EventBridge Lambda
> - 45-minute typical deployment time (proven at AAA Financial Services with 847 VMs)
>
> **Public docs & live site:**
> https://keysight-tech.github.io/cloudlens-autopilot-docs/
>
> **Customer runbook (DOCX):**
> https://github.com/Keysight-Tech/cloudlens-autopilot-docs/raw/main/CloudLens-AutoPilot-Deployment-Runbook.docx
>
> **One-click deploy from your AWS Console:**
> https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keysight-Tech/cloudlens-autopilot-docs/main/cloudlens-autopilot.yaml&stackName=cloudlens-autopilot
>
> Before deploying, please subscribe to the 3 Keysight Marketplace products (one-time per AWS account). Direct links are on the public docs page under "AWS Marketplace prerequisites."
>
> Want me to walk through deployment live? Reply with a 30-minute slot and I'll bring an engineer.

> Best,
> [Your name]

## Kickoff email (after they sign)

**Subject:** CloudLens AutoPilot deployment kickoff — checklist for [Customer Name]

> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> Great news — we're ready to deploy CloudLens on your AWS account. Here's what we need from you to start:
>
> **From your side (estimate 1 hour total):**
>
> 1. **AWS account access** for a Keysight SE (IAM role with `AdministratorAccess` is easiest; we can scope down later)
> 2. **Marketplace subscriptions accepted** for the 3 Keysight products in your target AWS account:
>    - Keysight Vision One
>    - Keysight CloudLens Manager
>    - Keysight CloudLens Virtual Packet Broker
>    (Direct links here: https://keysight-tech.github.io/cloudlens-autopilot-docs/#prereq-deploys)
> 3. **EC2 key pair** created in the target region (we'll use this for emergency console access; not required for normal ops)
> 4. **Target VPC topology**: greenfield (we create a new VPC) or brownfield (we deploy into your existing VPC)?
> 5. **Tagged target instances** — the EC2 instances you want monitored need `cloudlens=true` + a `Platform` tag (`linux-docker`, `linux-podman`, or `windows`). Our `prep-targets.sh` script can auto-tag if needed.
>
> **From our side:**
>
> 1. SE-led CloudFormation or Terraform deployment (~10 min including waits)
> 2. KVO/CLMS/vPB EULA acceptance and license activation (~15 min)
> 3. Sensor rollout via SSM Run Command (5–60 min depending on fleet size — see https://keysight-tech.github.io/cloudlens-autopilot-docs/#scaling)
> 4. Verification + handoff to your team
>
> Shall we schedule the kickoff call? I have these slots available:
> - [Date / Time options]
>
> Best,
> [Your name]

## Day-of follow-up (during/after deployment)

**Subject:** CloudLens AutoPilot deployment — status update

> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> Quick status from today's session:
>
> ✅ **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)** — CloudFormation stack `cloudlens-autopilot` is in `CREATE_COMPLETE`. KVO, CLMS, vPB instances are up and reachable.
>
> ✅ **Phase 2 (Configuration)** — KVO EULA accepted, all 3 licenses activated, CLMS adopted, vPB onboarded via CLI, AWS Cloud Config committed.
>
> 🔄 **Phase 3 (Sensors)** — In progress. SSM Run Command is currently deploying to [N] tagged instances. Estimated completion: [time].
>
> **Access URLs (private, don't share):**
> - KVO: https://[kvo-public-ip]/ (admin / admin — please change on first login)
> - CLMS: https://[clms-public-ip]/ (admin / Cl0udLens@dm!n — please change)
> - vPB CLI: `ssh -p 9022 admin@[vpb-public-ip]` (default password `ixia`)
>
> I'll send a final report once Phase 3 completes with the sensor registration count and CloudWatch dashboard link.
